# FOUNDATION : Interfaces for differently-aged population groups

Technological advancement such as [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) UI is where human interaction with machines occur. For AI to be used by humans, a user interface UI is required, they perform actions that the machine observes, percepts and as a result based on this observation the machine complies with humans. It is evident that age is an authorative factor in terms of accessibility, usability, psychology and User Interface design, everything and anything is accessibile on the web these days, nevertheless the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG) 2.0" states that Interfaces created for the general public (all age groups) should be based on their accessibility rather than usabilty.

With age, people go through certain fundamental changes that are almost inevitable. The Mental decay that happens with age for many adults is mostly related to memory and concentration. Many of today's older generation have only logged on for the very first time. Impaired Senses such as Vision loss is the most occuring disability recorded in the United States, UI designers are ought to create websites that are readily accessible to the older adults. Obviously most adults with vision disability use reading glasses. The need to keep text and button sizes large is a must especially on the websites that are to be accessed by the adults. Adapting to the web is not a tough ask really, as on the other hand there are infants and younger children who are heavily dependent on the web, where they daily learn and gain knowledge. Consequently it is the duty of the User Interface designers to serve the purpose of the needs for all.

Designing User Interfaces for different age groups matters, No age group should be alienated, as all serve a purpose, we cannot ignore an entire user base, and the reason for the circumstance would be to consider the age of audience . For instance, while having hot beverages you consider the sugar levels for the elderly so as to make sure of avoiding too much sugar if it is a diabetic patient, and for younger children they usually prefer a beverage to be sweet. Similarly, all age groups that belong to different age brackets have different needs and neccessities. Web is an indispensible part of life for every individual regardless one isn't an expert at using computers.

Designing for children

When designing interfaces for the children two concepts are certain, First, It should be uncomplicated and effortless. Secondly, it should be user friendly in terms of educational and iconographical view front. A few key points are listed below : 
1. Keeping the Interfaces clean for the under ages.
2. Children attract attention when seeing vibrant and exotic colours.
3. Using relateable content from what they see on the TV or Youtube (Advertising) 
4. Include games that entertain and promote education(Keep it intresting).

Designing for Teenagers

As children grow the ability as well as their will to understand computers ameliorates, although teens usually intend to read less and view more of graphical content. Another aspect would be to keep the UI less naive, as teens that are over the age of 15 find it offensive for approaching a UI that is childish. Teenagers as digital users have shown to be more socially pensive on the web rather than discovering information that the web has to provide, They could interact on the social media platform for hours making use of the interface and sharing it among different people eventually helping promote the interface created by the UI designer, for Example Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.

Designing for Adults

Usability and accessibility on the web comes to light when we speak about adults and the reason for this particular circumstance is that adults are the average web user, and an adult has an ethical experience when it comes to using the web, regardless of the fact that most people know how to access the browser, they have no idea that a search engine is called a 'browser'. Usability and Accessibility are two key words for adults as they tend to access the web for a specific purpose, they aren't on the web for amusement and have an elementary objective as to what their desideratum is. Adults want their information as quickly as possible so the UI should be user-friendly(common for all ages) and effortless.

Designing for Elderly

Designing UI for the seniors who are more familiar to a world without the web rather than with it, Elder ones usually experience a downfall in their health mentally as well as physically, which affects the web in many different ways. They are not likely to get along with the technological enhancements as fast as the other age groups, and their capabilities to surf also declines. Apart from all that Designing for older people has its fair share of advantages, they access the web with the idea of discovering and exploring on the web with patience. Elderly people tend to involve themselves in communities as they are willing to take the time to research, read more and learn new things. For the UI's to be easily accessible to the elderly certain aspects that need to be taken into consideration are:
1. UI's should have a large enough size of the text.
2. Everything should be readly visible.
3. Everything should be easily accessible such as in text links.

Age of the population matters

When you buy a bouquet of flowers for a special someone, and consider buying the ones that the someone have a soft spot for(White Roses)in the same lines, UI's for differently aged population also needs to be designed on the basis of the needs of the age groups. All websites need to be easily accessible, meeting all the criterias and an amusement for all age groups.
